An ATM Interface in Java simulates the interaction between a user and an ATM machine. It typically includes functions for performing tasks such as checking the balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and 
exiting. Below is an overview of how you could implement an ATM system with an interface in Java, along with code examples for each part.

1. Designing the ATM Interface
The ATM Interface typically allows a user to:
View their current balance.
Deposit money.
Withdraw money.
Exit the system.

3. Implementation Plan
The system will consist of:
User class: Contains user details like account number, balance, etc.
ATM Interface: Defines the ATM functionalities (view balance, deposit, withdraw, exit).
ATM Implementation: Implements the ATM functionalities.
ATM Main UI: Provides the user with a console-based interface to interact with the ATM system.
